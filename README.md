# react-landing-pages
This repo contains a collection of landing pages written in React.js. At the moment, I have only one landing page, but I'm hoping that with time, I'll have converted (or reactified) a few landing pages that I find on the web. The goal is that you can clone this project, use one of the landing page that you like, modify it, and get your own web app up and running in no time.

# Introduction
This project is a full bootstrap application with a collection of landing pages. The following technologies are being used:

  a) React.js (also using React router)
  b) scss pre-processor
  c) Node.js (Using Express)
  d) React Router
  e) Webpack

# Installation
1. Once you have cloned the repo, run npm install. This will install the node modules needed to run the applicaiton.


# What's included

# Demo on Heroku
https://pure-coast-95501.herokuapp.com/

# How to run the app locally
npm run dev

# How to deploy on heroku

I have a postInstall script in package.json that will build the app with webpack.
Webpack and other npm modules to build the app are in devDependencies. In order to build on Heroku, you have to do the following:

heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false

which will allow heroku to install modules in devDependencies.
